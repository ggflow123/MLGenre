Machine Learning on Music Genre Classification

Author: Yuanzhe Liu



# Description:

This is the project about using machine learning to classify music genres. 

Right now the dataset is the Million Song Subset. This is the link: http://millionsongdataset.com/

The Machine Learning Algorithm is Support Vector Machine. The accuracy is terrible, only 3%.

Since Every attribute with array doesn't share equal length in each instance, right now I ignore all of them. I will deal with them after.



# Usage:

First, use generate_dataset.py to change the dataset into the form that we can feed into machine learning.

generate_dataset.py: takes in the MillionSongSubset, then return a .csv file with labels and attributes.

```
python3 generate_dataset.py MillionSongSubset
```

Then, we use the simple_data.csv generated by generate_dataset.py to run machine learning:

```
python3 mlgenre.py simple_data.csv 0.75 12345
```

where 0.75 is the percentage of the training dataset, and 12345 is the seed of your choice.

It will generate a confusion matrix in .csv file.
